My name is Camilo MartÃ­nez Burgos (he/him) and I'm an economist from BogotÃ¡, Colombia ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡´ who is passionate about data science and programming. A few years ago I started my path in this subject by learning to work with R and the tidyverse. Since then, I have learned about git and github, python, postgresql, docker, among other tools.

I believe that data is key to understand the world and to improve decision-making, both for people and organizations. For this reason I decided to open a [blog](www.camartinezbu.com) where I explain varios data science concepts. I want more people to be able to apply data analysis tools in their daily or work life and, if possible, remove the taboo on the difficulty of data science based on simple and intuitive explanations.

I'm an economist and I'm about to complete my Master's degree in the same topic. I have more than 5 years of experience working on public policy issues in Colombia. I have worked as an Economic Advisor in the National Business Council and as an Analyst of Smart Cities and Urban Security in ProBogotÃ¡ Region.
